# NYC-Public-Schools-Test
## Project Description
Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admissions process.

In this project, I worked with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools.

I looked at how performance varied by borough, identified how many schools failed to report information, and found the top ten performing schools across the city!
